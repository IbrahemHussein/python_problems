# Todo:Write a Python Program to calculate difference of two set
# A = {1,12,2,6,7,8} B = {15,0,1,3,6}
A = {1, 12, 2, 6, 7, 8}
B = {15, 0, 1, 3, 6}
# Algorithm
# Step1: Get Set A
A = {1, 12, 2, 6, 7, 8}

# Step2: Get Set B
B = {15, 0, 1, 3, 6}

# Step3: Display Element of A set that are not present in B set
